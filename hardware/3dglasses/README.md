# Arduino Driven 3D shutter glasses for Vectrex

This project contains some Arduino code, a document and a video that shows how to build a Vectrex 3D Imager with and Arduino Uno, a pair of active 3D shutter glasses and an H-bridge.

The video shows the view through the right lens playing 3D Minestorm.

3d_glasses.ino has the code for the H-bridge control of the glasses.

ir_glasses is code to experiment with Infrared pair of glasses controlled by an IR LED. It works but at this time the frequency of the glasses cannot be lowered enough to be useful for Vectrex 3d application.
